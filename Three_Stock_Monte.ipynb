    "**Question:** Based on the above information, which set of investments gives you the best chance of a profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** If the portfolio is tailored to a weight favoring Nike then the chances for profit are higher within a 95% confidence interval. Even though the bottom of the interval is lower it is only about a 1,000 difference from the even weighted distribution which has the next highest profit opportunity. Comparing the ceiling of profit opportunity, investing more heavily in Nike could potentially earn someone around 40,000. Whereas an even weighted investment is only predicted to cap at around 25,000. Someone who weights their 15,000 investment on Nike has the chance to earn 15,000 more than someone with an evenly weighted investment while only risking on the lower end a 1000 earning difference."
